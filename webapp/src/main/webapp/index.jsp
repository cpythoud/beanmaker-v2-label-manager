<h1>Beanmaker Label Manager</h1>
<p>
    This the Beanmaker Label Manager test web-app.
</p>
<p>
    To deploy it on your platform, the label-manager-lib-{version}.jar must be on your classpath and the directory
    /label-manager should be copied to some appropriate  place. The directory can be renamed.
</p>
<p>
    You should also include (and possibly edit) the servlet definitions present in the web.xml file into your
    own application web.xml.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, when you initialize your application, you should use the Configuration class to set up the proper
    settings for table and field names.
